      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>9/10 employers feel that students are not adequately prepared for the workplace</li>
      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>Only 8% of managers feel that entry-level employees are prepared to immediately contribute to their organization</li>
      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>Insert another pain-extracting statistic (perhaps how many people hate their jobs/are underemployed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s get real: The current curriculum is boring, antiquated and AVAILABLE FOR FREE <em>(if you look hard enough)</em> anywhere on the internet.  Plus anyone in “the real world” <em>(who is going to give it to you straight)</em> will tell you, “college didn’t teach me anything useful…”</p>
    <p>If you have always sensed this disconnect in your education but haven’t been sure of what to do about it, WELCOME TO THE PARTY:</p>
    <h2>We Prepare Young Adults For The Reality Of Business With The Relevant, Practical, and Lucrative Skills They’ll Never Learn In School</h2>
    <ul class="app-ul-fa fa-ul">
      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>No Nonsense, Fluff, or BS</li>
      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>No useless memorization or buzzword regurgitation</li>
      <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>No more buying expensive textbooks you’ll never read</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don’t need more INFORMATION or KNOWLEDGE (that’s all a commodity now, thanks to GOOGLE). You need real world ACTION and the SKILLS that come from developing yourself outside the classroom.</p>

      <p>Your classes are filled with INFORMATION but give you no practical experience outside the classroom. The only SKILLS you develop are memorization and regurgitation.  And internships really only introduce you to the corporate environment, they don’t train you.</p>
      <p>We’re building the most ACTIONABLE training platform for young adults to help them develop the SKILLS they need to build their own business or help someone else build theirs.  COMING SOON. Only training being offered right now is through The Workshop School of Action.</p>

      <p>If you are an aspiring entrepreneur between the ages of 16 and 36 and you’re overwhelmed by all the information, strategies, and NOISE in the world right now for entrepreneurs, <strong>be careful, something (even more substantial) is missing from your entrepreneurial education</strong>.</p>
      <ul class="app-ul-fa fa-ul">
        <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>Forget the world of APPS and the allure of Silicon Valley</li>
        <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>Forget about coding, hackathon ing, and raising capital</li>
        <li><i class="app-fa fa fa-check"></i>Forget about everything you think you know about starting a business</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There’s a reason 9/10 businesses (entrepreneurs) FAIL. Find out more about this problem and our premier training program <a href="#">The Workshop School of Action</a>.</p>
